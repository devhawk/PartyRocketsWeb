	<p>The PParty Rockets are looking for donations to help defray the costs of competing in the Destination Imagination Global Finals tournament&nbsp;in Knoxville, Tennessee.</p>
	<p>Beyond the obvious costs of flights to and hotel rooms in Tennessee, there is also significant cost to entering the tournament itself as well as shipping the team's props. We estimate it's going to cost almost $12,000 to enter the tournament, get the team (plus their coach, team manager and props) to Knoxville and put them up in a hotel and feed them while they're there.</p>
	<p>If you'd like to help sponsor the Party Rockets trip to Global Finals this year, you can make a tax-deductible donation to the <a href="http://www.wa-di.org/">Washington Imagination Network</a>&nbsp;(aka W.I.N.) in the Awesome Assemblers name. W.I.N. is the Washington state affiliate organization for Destination ImagiNation. 100% of the money donated to W.I.N. in the team's name - as well as any employer matching funds - will go to cover the team expenditures for Global Finals. Any money over and above those costs (should we be so lucky!) will stay with W.I.N. to assist them in their mission to provide creative problem-solving opportunities for the youth of Washington state.</p>
